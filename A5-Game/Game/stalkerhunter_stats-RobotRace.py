    """
    Adaptive gold-chasing bot with three strategies that activate in sequence.

    Strategies:
        blind_chaser  — default; sprints aggressively for every pot.
        camping       — activates after LOSING_STREAK_THRESHOLD consecutive
                        losing pots; stalks the gold and grabs at the last moment.
        rivalry       — activates if camping also fails over STRATEGY_PATIENCE pots;
                        competes directly using full ETA-based sprint calculations.

    Transitions:
        blind_chaser → rivalry    if the bot has spent 500 rounds in blind_chaser
                                  and is no longer in 1st place (or drops from 1st).
        blind_chaser → camping    after 3 consecutive losing pots, or immediately
                                  if a single round causes a 2-rank drop.
        camping      → rivalry    if average rank over STRATEGY_PATIENCE pots
                                  remains at or below LOSING_RANK_THRESHOLD.
        camping      → rivalry    emergency override if score gap to leader exceeds
                                  RIVALRY_SCORE_MARGIN (is_forced_rivalry).

    Fallback when not chasing:
        - If a path to gold exists but was declined: move to spawn-positioning
          target (opposite side of map from current gold, near center).
        - If no path to gold exists at all (blind_chaser only): explore toward
          the nearest frontier tile bordering unknown map area.
        Fallback targets are locked for the entire pot lifetime to prevent
        oscillation from round-to-round re-evaluation.
