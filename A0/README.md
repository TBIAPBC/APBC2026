# A0 - Warm up assignment: Hello World

Dear APBC students,

in this assignment, you should write---for warm up---a program that
accepts a single file name on the command line and prints (to standard
output)

  * "Hello World!", adding a line break
  * and the content of the file
  * NO additional line break
  * use [HelloWorld-test1.in](https://github.com/TBIAPBC/APBC2025/blob/master/A0/HelloWorld-test1.in) as input
  * output should be like [HelloWorld-test1.out](https://github.com/TBIAPBC/APBC2025/blob/master/A0/HelloWorld-test1.out)

Then, submit your program via Github (of course, this step is the
actual purpose of the HelloWorld assignment, which should be simple to
implement for all of you, otherwise.) For these tasks follow the
instructions below.

For the interesting part of this assignment, i.e. the submission, we
need a few preparations:

* Register as user in Github (github.com), if you didn't do so already.

* Mail us (akilar at tbi.univie.ac.at) your clear name and github
  account name, such that we can register you as member of our team on
  Github.

* Find this text at https://github.com/TBIAPBC/APBC2026/tree/master/A0

* Read some git documentation (git-scm.com), e.g. start with this [Introduction](https://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/~jlandersen/_static/git.pdf).
  After getting some idea, it's best to learn the rest while using git. Probably handy are Git Cheat Sheets,
  e.g. [this](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf).
  Moreover, git is always there to help (use '--help') on the linux command line. For example
```
  git help
  git help tutorial
  git clone --help
```

Now let's get to the thing:

* Open a Linux terminal

* Clone our APBC-Github repository from https://github.com/TBIAPBC/APBC2026. For this purpose, run in the terminal
```
  git clone git@github.com:TBIAPBC/APBC2026.git
```
  to clone using [SSH](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/about-ssh).

  If you clone via SSH, you might consider [SSH Keys](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent), which allow you to connect to GitHub without supplying your username and password each time.

  The clone command fills the directory APBC2026 with the contents from the central repository (together with all the version and meta-information in subdirectory .git).
* Unless already done, configure your user name and email address:
```
  cd APBC2026
  git config user.name "your name"
  git config user.email "your mail address"
```

* Create a new branch named after your GitHub user name (and the current assignment), and switch to the new branch
```
  git checkout -b $githubname-A0
```

* __NOTE: You should NEVER write anything into the master branch of our repository!__ Always use your *own branch*. To this end, create a new branch for every assignment, e.g. $githubname-A0 / $githubname-A1 etc.

* Write the "Hello world" program according to the above specification. The programming language is your choice (as for all coming assignments).

* Copy the solution to subdir A0; the file must be named following this scheme: $githubname-HelloWorld.$suffix,
  where the suffix depends on your programming language; e.g. suffix='.py'

* Add your changes and commit them. For this, run these commands in the root dir of APBC2026:
```
  git add A0/$githubname-HelloWorld.$suffix
  git commit
```

* Push your branch to the same branch in the repository on Github
```
  git push --set-upstream origin $branchname
```
  (with $branchname being e.g. $githubname-A0). The --set-upstream causes git to remember the upstream branch; it can be ommitted in follow-up pushs from your branch.

* Go to https://github.com/TBIAPBC/APBC206; make a pull request (PR) from your branch into the master branch. This tells others that you are ready for code review.

* If you get stuck let us know via the comment functionality in the PR on GitHub. Include all necessary information, what went wrong and how we can help e.g.:

```
  ping @amkilar
  My program is not executed with error XYZ
```

* After successful testing (optional) and if you like your program, write another comment (alternatively, file a review request) to let your colleagues know they
  should review the submission.

```
  @TBIAPBC/APBC2026 , please review
```

Happy hacking!
